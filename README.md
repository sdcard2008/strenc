## What is strenc?

Strenc , or String(str)Encoder(enc) , is a pip package that will encode and decode a piece of string into cryptic message and to normal text.

## Why is it 'customizable'?

We have a command line tool added with the package , that will help you create keys , check which character is replaced by which and change the keys.
